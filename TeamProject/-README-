This is a group task I did with a coursemate where we used body tracking to allow the user to program using only tracking and verbal commands. This programme also allowed the user to be taught how to program the basics and users a fully function keyboard and buttons on the interface.

This project incorporated both of our knowledge of Python, interfaces and the use of gestures. We investigated whos previous tasks could be most beneficial then improved them by adding the needed code to complete the task
